# Beacon Login

**Pull the cord. The login appears.**

**Live demo:** [veraetogrex-portfolio.github.io/beacon-login](https://veraetogrex-portfolio.github.io/beacon-login/) · **Mockup:** [full-screen version](https://veraetogrex-portfolio.github.io/beacon-login/mockup/beacon-login.html)

Pull the cord: the beacon flickers on, a cone of light falls across the page and the sign-in card develops out of the dark. Pull again to switch it off.

## Use it

Three files, no build step, no dependencies, no web fonts:

```
index.html   markup
style.css    styles and keyframes
script.js    behaviour
```

Download the repo and open `index.html`, or copy the three files into your project.

## Try it

- Drag the crystal on the cord down and let go.
- `L` anywhere, or `Enter` / `Space` on the focused cord.

## Make it yours

The form is a plain `<form>` in `index.html` with submit switched off (`onsubmit="return false"`). Wire it to your auth. Colours are CSS custom properties at the top of `style.css`.

`prefers-reduced-motion` is respected: heavy motion drops to short fades.

## What's in `mockup/`

The full 1440×900 screen this component was shot in for the reel:

- `mockup/beacon-login.html` — interactive. `D` plays the demo, `R` resets.
- `mockup/beacon-login.autoplay.html` — the scripted ~6 s loop with a drawn cursor.
- URL flags: `?frame` puts the screen in a browser window, `?clean` hides the control panel, `?once` plays the demo once.

The mockup uses a shared stage runtime and bundled fonts from `mockup/_shared/`. The component in the root doesn't need any of it.
